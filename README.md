Welcome back to my Library Management system! 

This version has been updated to integrate a MYSQL database and showcase data manipulation. 

BEFORE THIS CODE IS RAN: information for the database being worked on needs to be entered (in each module) 

You will need to enter in:
- The name of the Database
- Password for MYSQL Workbench
- Username for workbench database
- Host Name for workbench database

All code has been run and tested with my own personal datatbase, but you can work this code in with any datatbase you have. 

Otherwise, all functions are similar to the old Library Management system, where a user can: 
- Add a book, user, or author to the database
- View all books, users, and authors currently in the Library System
- Borrow and Return Books within the Library 
- Search for a specific author, user, or book in the library system 

Images of the Database I was working with are included to give some insight as to how the tables looked and what information was there. 

Thank you very much!
